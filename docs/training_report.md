- Validation Accuracy: Improved from ~50% to ~70%

### Learning Rate
- Initial Learning Rate: 0.001
- Cosine Annealing Schedule: T_0=10, T_mult=2
- Learning rate decreased smoothly following cosine schedule

## Model Architecture
- Audio-Visual Fusion Network
- Input: Video frames and audio features
- Output: Binary classification (real/fake)

## Training Configuration
- Batch Size: 32
- Optimizer: Adam
- Scheduler: CosineAnnealingWarmRestarts
- Early Stopping: Patience=5, min_delta=0.001

## Key Observations
1. Model showed good convergence on training data
2. Some signs of overfitting after epoch 15
3. Early stopping prevented severe overfitting
4. Learning rate schedule helped with optimization

## Recommendations
1. Consider data augmentation to reduce overfitting
2. Experiment with different model architectures
3. Try different learning rate schedules
4. Implement cross-validation for more robust evaluation

## Next Steps
1. Evaluate model on test set
2. Analyze misclassified samples
3. Consider ensemble methods
4. Fine-tune hyperparameters
